# Help us to make a better tool

## By creating issue-tickets

When you think you found a bug, please check the issue-tracker at github first, if it isn't already reported. If you are unsure about having the same bug, don't hesitate to create a new issue-ticket, we will inform you about via comment or closing.


## By creating patches, features or pull-requests

When you managed to find some time in creating a patch or implemented a new feature, please create small pull-requests. Having to merge a pull-request with different fixes or several new features is no easy task and won't be accepted (exceptions of this may occur when having similar small fixes).


## Some words about code-formatters and comments

We love code-formatters, but until we have strict requirements for this project (we don't have them currently), please **do not** apply your formatter over the whole code, just on your changes should be enough. It shortens the time to check pull-requests for the change you really made (and not making the code look worse than it is).

If there are some comments you find irritating or confusing (or even being wrong), just create a pull-request to adjust these parts.


## Inform others about us

This project lives from the usage by others, show it to some colleagues, use it in your spare-time-projects and feel free to spread this project all over the world. Every move to keep this project alive and kicking is very welcome.
